# onepage-wargame
Simple, easily modifiable hex boardgame in a webpage with only JS and CSS.

## overview
One Page Wargame is an example of using easily modifiable, well understood HTML, CSS, and JS to instantly set up a wargame.

Each hexagon is a div element, and each unit is a draggable div, and easily customizable in CSS.

After defining the rows and columns of your mapboard, the hexes are written in Javascript, and hex ID's are added as well.
